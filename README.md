# Knave Mobile App
A mobile application for the Knave, a role playing game by Ben Milton

This app was originally made to play around with webkit animations. It soon evolved into experiments with JavaScript's touch API, then into a mock mobile application, and now into the framework for my Knave mobile app. 

I'll get to writing more about this when the app is closer to being ready to deploy. As for now, please ignore the hacked together JavaScript code. There is a lot left in there from when this was being used for webkit animations, and not all of the code will reflect the purpose of this app until I go in and clean it up.
